Steps to use:
1) Modify analysis.c:load_halo_finder_catalog to select which halos you want to analyze (by mass, particle count, index, etc)
2) Modify analysis.c:compute_halo_properties to set the maximum radius around each halo to select, and initialize any global variables/arrays you need
3) Modify analysis.c:particle_callback and cell_callback to analyze the particle and cell variables

Then run using (assuming hfind is in HC/, data in DAT/)
./cart_analyze_generic 60.0 L60csf DAT/ HC/ 1.000
